# Face-Mask-Detection
During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus.

We are going to build this project in two parts. In the first part, we will write a python script using Keras to train face mask detector model. In the second part, we test the results in a real-time webcam using OpenCV.

1. Import all the libraries and modules required.
2. Build the neural network.
3. Image Data Generation/Augmentation.
4. Initialize a callback checkpoint to keep saving best model after each epoch while training.
5. Train the model.
6. Make a python file “testing.py”
7. Run the project.

# Requirements
Google colab
Jupyter

In this project we trained the model using google colab and tested with jupyter.
